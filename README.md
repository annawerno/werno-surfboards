# Welcome to Werno Surfboards
 ## This website is my current pet project from idea 💡 to conception 💻 
 ### This is a work in progress 🛠️, please view below the completed stages:
 
1️⃣ Brief and taskflow: using Figma to create a style guide and wireframes in both low fidelity (LoFi) and high fidelity (HiFi)

2️⃣ Using VS Code, built the first phase of the website, the homepage. This currently includes a responsive design from 730px +
Deployed via Netlify, view this here: https://werno-surfboards.netlify.app/

3️⃣ Added the first lines of JavaScript to create the modal pop up window to subscribe to a newsletter. Updated deployment on Netlify

4️⃣ Well what an absolute nightmare and many lessons learnt in this next step. Having added multiple pages to my website, I made the rookie mistake of renaming my index.html. Just this little change, made me spend a few good hours trying to decipher why my links weren't working; why the netlify deployment stopped working; why my numerous commits to GitHub were not working; and the list could go on. Essentially a whole can of worms opened up because I wanted to be tidy with my files 🤦‍♀️ In the end, I had flunked my original GitHub repo royally so started afresh. I absolutely know that this is not the correct way of using version control and with that I will take a detour and review my knowledge of Git!

Seems this pet project progress (quite the mouthful!), will not be running as smooth as I had hoped but I hear that can be the way with web development. The important thing is to learn from the mistakes - which, on this occassion, I most definitely have 🥴
